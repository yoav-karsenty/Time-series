# Time-series
in this project, for Sweet Lift Taxi company, i have historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, i need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour.i will build a model for such a prediction.

The RMSE metric on the test set should not be more than 48.

What i will do:
1. Download the data and resample it by one hour.
2. Analyze the data.
3. Train different models with different hyperparameters. The test sample should be 10% of the initial dataset.
4. Test the data using the test sample and provide a conclusion.
